## 1.0.1 - 2025-09-30
### ✨ New Features
- **FlipSettings Controls**: Added `hideLeftShadow` to individually disable the left page shadow in single-page mode.
- **Vertical Flip Mode**: Introduced `onlyVerticalPageFlip` to support vertical-only page flipping by clamping gestures to the bottom edge.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes
- **Page Navigation**: Fixed `nextPage`/`previousPage` not working after the first page by resetting navigation state with a fresh key and animation timing.
- **Animation Lifecycle**: Ensured flip animations restart correctly by initializing `startedAt` whenever a new flip begins.

### 🚀 Enhancements
- **Example App UX**: Revamped the example to load pages asynchronously, show a loading indicator, and expose floating navigation buttons once data arrives.

### 🧹 Chores
- **Tooling**: Added `.fvmrc` to pin the Flutter version used for development.

## 1.0.0 - 2025-08-17
### 🔄 MAJOR ARCHITECTURE OVERHAUL
**BREAKING CHANGES:**

### ✨ New Features
- **Smart Gesture Detection**: Automatic differentiation between drag (page flip) and tap (widget interaction)
- **TurnablePdf Widget**: Built‑in PDF page flip viewer (asset / network / file) with single & double page modes, shimmer loading, custom loading/error builders, spine effect, and interactive page rendering
- **Interactive Widgets**: Buttons and other widgets within pages now work natively without any conversion
- **Enhanced Physics**: Added inertia, easing, and realistic page bending animations
- **Improved Performance**: Eliminated expensive widget-to-image conversion pipeline
- **Better Hit Testing**: Intelligent detection of interactive widgets vs page flip areas

### 🏗️ Technical Improvements
